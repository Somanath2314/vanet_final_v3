## 🔧 System Architecture

### Components Created

1. **`sumo_ns3_bridge.py`** - Bridge between SUMO and NS3
   - Reads vehicle positions from SUMO via TraCI
   - Detects emergency vehicles automatically
   - Simulates WiFi and WiMAX communications
   - Calculates PDR, delay, throughput

2. **`run_integrated_simulation.py`** - Main runner
   - Integrates SUMO traffic controller
   - Runs NS3 bridge in parallel
   - Collects and saves metrics
   - Supports RL and rule-based control

3. **`run_integrated_sumo_ns3.sh`** - Easy launcher script
   - One-command execution
   - Handles SUMO setup
   - Manages output files

### How It Works

```
Step 1: SUMO advances traffic simulation
   ↓
Step 2: Bridge reads vehicle positions via TraCI
   ↓
Step 3: For each vehicle:
   - Check if emergency vehicle
   - Calculate distances to other vehicles/RSUs
   - Select protocol (WiFi or WiMAX)
   - Simulate packet transmission
   ↓
Step 4: Record metrics (PDR, delay, success)
   ↓
Step 5: Repeat for next step
```

## 📈 Network Protocols

### WiFi 802.11p (V2V and Normal V2I)

```
Standard: IEEE 802.11p (WAVE/DSRC)
Frequency: 5.9 GHz
Range: 300 meters
Beacon Rate: 10 Hz
PDR: 92-98% (distance-dependent)
Delay: 20-50ms
Use: Vehicle-to-vehicle, normal vehicle-to-RSU
```

### WiMAX (Emergency V2I)

```
Standard: IEEE 802.16e (Mobile WiMAX)
Range: 1000 meters
PDR: 95-99%
Delay: 15-30ms
Priority: High
Use: Emergency vehicle-to-RSU only
Trigger: Automatic when vehicle type contains "emergency" or "ambulance"
```

## 🚑 Emergency Vehicle Handling

### Automatic Detection

The system automatically detects emergency vehicles:

```python
# In sumo_ns3_bridge.py
vtype = traci.vehicle.getTypeID(vid)
is_emergency = 'emergency' in vtype.lower() or 'ambulance' in vtype.lower()
```

### Protocol Switching

```python
if vehicle.is_emergency:
    # Use WiMAX for better range and reliability
    protocol = 'wimax'
    range_m = 1000
    base_delay_ms = 15
else:
    # Use WiFi for normal vehicles
    protocol = 'wifi'
    range_m = 300
    base_delay_ms = 20
```

### Priority Communication

Emergency vehicles get:
- ✅ Longer range (1000m vs 300m)
- ✅ Better PDR (95-99% vs 92-98%)
- ✅ Lower delay (15-30ms vs 20-50ms)
- ✅ Separate metrics tracking

### Citation

```
The VANET system integrates SUMO traffic simulation with network 
communication simulation supporting IEEE 802.11p (V2V) and IEEE 802.16e 
(WiMAX for emergency V2I). Vehicle positions from SUMO are used in 
real-time to calculate communication ranges and network performance 
metrics including packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and 
emergency vehicle communication success rates.
