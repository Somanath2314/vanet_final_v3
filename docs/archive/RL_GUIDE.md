# Reinforcement Learning Guide

## Overview

This project includes a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** traffic control system that learns optimal traffic light timing using neural networks. The RL agent uses **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** to make intelligent traffic light decisions based on real-time traffic conditions.

## Quick Start

### Run RL Simulation
```bash
cd /home/mahesh/Desktop/capstone/vanet_final_v3
source venv/bin/activate
./run_sumo_rl.sh
```

### Train RL Agent
```bash
cd rl_module
python train_working.py --episodes 100 --steps 1000
```

---

## Architecture

### RL Components

1. **Environment** (`vanet_env.py`)
   - Gymnasium-compatible RL environment
   - State: vehicle speeds, positions, emissions, traffic light states
   - Actions: traffic light phase changes
   - Rewards: traffic flow, waiting times, emissions

2. **Agent** (`SimpleDQNAgent`)
   - Deep Q-Network neural network
   - Experience replay buffer (10,000 transitions)
   - Epsilon-greedy exploration (ε=1.0 → 0.01)

3. **Controller** (`rl_traffic_controller.py`)
   - Integrates RL agent with SUMO simulation
   - Handles model loading and inference
   - Provides real-time metrics

### Neural Network Architecture

```
Input (84 dimensions) → Hidden (128) → Hidden (128) → Output (16 actions)
     ↑                           ↑                    ↑
Vehicle speeds, positions,     ReLU activation     Traffic light phases
emissions, wait times, acc.    ↓                    for 2 intersections
Traffic light states         ReLU activation       (4 phases × 4 phases)
```

## Training

### Training Script
```bash
python train_working.py --episodes 100 --steps 1000
```

**Training Process:**
1. Initialize DQN agent with state/action dimensions
2. For each episode:
   - Reset SUMO simulation
   - Collect experiences (state, action, reward, next_state)
   - Train neural network on random batches
   - Update target network periodically
   - Decay exploration rate (ε)
3. Save best and final models

**Hyperparameters:**
- Learning rate: 0.001
- Discount factor (γ): 0.99
- Replay buffer: 10,000
- Batch size: 64
- Target network update: every 10 episodes

### Training Output
```
Episode 0/100: Reward=-125.45, Loss=0.0234, ε=0.995
Episode 50/100: Reward=-45.23, Loss=0.0087, ε=0.975
Episode 100/100: Reward=23.45, Loss=0.0021, ε=0.951

Training completed! Best reward: 23.45
Model saved to models/dqn_traffic_model.pth
```

## Inference

### Running RL Control
```bash
./run_sumo_rl.sh
```

**What Happens:**
1. Loads trained DQN model (or uses random policy if no model)
2. Connects to SUMO simulation via TraCI
3. For each simulation step:
   - Gets current traffic state (vehicle positions, speeds, etc.)
   - Neural network selects optimal traffic light action
   - Applies action to SUMO traffic lights
   - Tracks metrics (reward, episode length, etc.)

**Output:**
```
Step 0: Reward=-1.23, Episode Reward=-1.23
Step 100: Reward=-0.87, Episode Reward=-89.45
Step 200: Reward=-1.12, Episode Reward=-178.34

Simulation completed after 1000 steps
```

## State & Action Spaces

### State (84 dimensions)
- **Vehicle data** (10 vehicles × 7 features):
  - Speed, 3D orientation, CO2 emissions, wait steps, acceleration
- **Traffic light data** (2 intersections):
  - Binary state encoding, wait steps

### Actions (16 possibilities)
- **Intersection J2**: 4 phases (East-West, North-South, transitions)
- **Intersection J3**: 4 phases (East-West, North-South, transitions)
- **Combined**: 4 × 4 = 16 possible joint actions

### Rewards
```python
reward = penalize_low_speeds() + penalize_long_waits() + penalize_jerky_movements()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Import Errors**
```bash
# Fix: Update imports in vanet_env.py
# Use absolute imports instead of relative imports
```

**2. SUMO Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check: SUMO installation and configuration
sumo --version
# Verify: simulation.sumocfg paths
```

**3. Model Loading Errors**
```bash
# Check: Model file exists and paths are correct
ls -lh rl_module/models/
```

**4. API Compatibility**
```bash
# Fixed: Automatic detection of Gymnasium vs gym APIs
# No manual intervention needed
```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test environment
cd rl_module && python -c "
import gymnasium as gym
from vanet_env import VANETTrafficEnv
env = VANETTrafficEnv({'beta': 5, 'algorithm': 'DQN'})
state = env.reset()
print(f'State shape: {state.shape}')
env.close()
"

# Test SUMO connection
python -c "import traci, sumolib; print('SUMO OK')"

# Check model
python -c "
import torch
model = torch.load('rl_module/models/dqn_traffic_model.pth')
print(f'Model keys: {model.keys()}')
"
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Training
```python
# Modify hyperparameters in train_working.py
agent = SimpleDQNAgent(state_dim, action_dim, learning_rate=0.001)
# Adjust: gamma, epsilon_decay, batch_size, etc.
```

### Custom Rewards
```python
# Modify compute_reward() in vanet_env.py
def compute_reward(self, action):
    # Add: fuel consumption, safety metrics, etc.
    return custom_reward_function()
```

### Multi-Agent Setup
```python
# Extend to: independent agents per intersection
agents = [DQNAgent() for _ in intersections]
# Implement: coordination mechanisms
```

---

## Integration with Rule-Based System

The RL system integrates seamlessly with the existing rule-based controller:

```python
# Switch between control modes
if use_rl:
    controller = RLTrafficController()
else:
    controller = AdaptiveTrafficController()

controller.run_simulation()
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **A/B Testing** - Compare RL vs rule-based performance
- ✅ **Hybrid Control** - Use RL for complex scenarios, rules for simple ones
- ✅ **Gradual Deployment** - Start with rule-based, transition to RL
