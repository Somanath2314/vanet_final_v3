# Traffic Control Optimization - 30 Oct 2025

## Problems Identified from Logs

### 1. ❌ Fog Server RL Not Working
```
ERROR: No module named 'gym'
RL Enabled: False
```
**Impact:** Fog using simple heuristics instead of intelligent RL decisions

### 2. ❌ Ambulance Getting Stuck
```
emergency_1 at (488.0, 495.2), speed 0.0 m/s
J2: N=0.30 (vehicles blocking)
```
**Impact:** Ambulances waiting too long at junctions

### 3. ❌ Override Cooldown Too Long
```
⏳ Override cooldown active (10s)
```
**Impact:** Can't change lights quickly when ambulance arrives

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Enable Fog RL (fog_server.py)
- Added fallback: `gymnasium` → `gym` → error message
- Better error handling if packages missing
- **Result:** Fog can now use trained RL model

### Fix 2: Faster Emergency Response (fog_server.py)
```python
# BEFORE
self.override_cooldown = 10  # seconds

# AFTER  
self.override_cooldown = 3  # seconds - reduced for faster response
```
**Result:** Lights can change every 3s instead of 10s when ambulance detected

### Fix 3: Longer Override Duration (fog_server.py)
```python
# BEFORE
duration_s=25

# AFTER
duration_s=30  # Increased to give ambulances more time
```
**Result:** Ambulances get 30s green light instead of 25s

### Fix 4: More Frequent RL Control (run_integrated_simulation.py)
```python
# BEFORE
if rl_controller and step % 10 == 0:

# AFTER
if rl_controller and step % 5 == 0:  # More frequent RL control
```
**Result:** RL makes decisions every 5 steps (0.5s) instead of 10 steps (1s)

### Fix 5: Fixed Double-Stepping Bug (vanet_env.py)
- Added `apply_action()` method that sets lights WITHOUT calling `traci.simulationStep()`
- Prevents simulation from advancing twice on RL steps
- **Result:** RL actions applied at correct time

## Expected Improvements

1. ✅ **Fog RL Working:** Intelligent decisions based on trained model
2. ✅ **Faster Emergency Response:** 3s cooldown instead of 10s
3. ✅ **Better Ambulance Flow:** 30s green light + more frequent updates
4. ✅ **More Responsive Traffic:** RL updates every 0.5s instead of 1s
5. ✅ **Accurate Timing:** No more double-stepping bug

## Testing Instructions

1. **Install gymnasium:**
   ```bash
   pip install gymnasium
   ```

2. **Restart system:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   ./run_integrated_sumo_ns3.sh --rl --gui
   
   # Terminal 2 (after backend starts)
   python fog_server.py --backend http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Watch for these improvements:**
   - Fog logs should show: `✅ RL controller and model loaded successfully`
   - No more: `RL Enabled: False`
   - Ambulances should move faster through junctions
   - Queue lengths should decrease faster when direction gets green
   - Logs show RL actions every 5 steps instead of 10

## Performance Metrics to Monitor

- **Ambulance speed:** Should be > 10 m/s, not 0.0 m/s
- **Queue clearance:** N/S/E/W queues should drop from 0.30 → 0.00 within 5-10s
- **Override frequency:** Should see new overrides every 3-5s when ambulance present
- **RL decisions:** Should see `🤖 RL controlling traffic` every 5 steps
