# ✅ Documentation Consolidation Complete!

## 🎉 **Successfully Consolidated to 2 Essential Files**

### What Was Accomplished:

1. **✅ Created `RL_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive RL documentation
   - Complete RL implementation guide
   - Architecture, training, and usage instructions
   - Troubleshooting and advanced configuration

2. **✅ Updated `README.md`** - Streamlined main documentation
   - Quick start guides for both control systems
   - Architecture overview and performance metrics
   - Installation, usage, and troubleshooting

3. **✅ Removed 20+ unnecessary markdown files**
   - Kept historical docs in `docs/archive/` for reference
   - Maintained clean, focused documentation
