## 🚦 **Traffic Light Control**

### **Intersections & Phases**

#### **J2 Intersection (4 phases)**
```
Phase 0: GGGrrr (East-West Green, North-South Red)
Phase 1: yyyrrr (East-West Yellow, North-South Red)
Phase 2: rrrGGG (East-West Red, North-South Green)
Phase 3: rrryyy (East-West Red, North-South Yellow)
```

#### **J3 Intersection (4 phases)**
```
Phase 0: GGGrrr (East-West Green, North-South Red)
Phase 1: yyyrrr (East-West Yellow, North-South Red)
Phase 2: rrrGGG (East-West Red, North-South Green)
Phase 3: rrryyy (East-West Red, North-South Yellow)
```

**🎯 Total Action Space: 16 combinations (4×4)**

### **Lane Configuration**
- **E1_0, E2_0:** East-West lanes (J2 ←→ J3)
- **E5_0, E7_0:** North-South lanes (J2, J3)

---

## 🚨 **Emergency Vehicle Priority System**

### **🚑 Detection & Response**
- **Detection Range:** 300m radius from intersections
- **Response Time:** Immediate green light priority
- **Extension Time:** Extended green phase for emergency passage
- **Reward Bonus:** +100 points for proper emergency handling

### **Emergency Types**
- 🚑 **Ambulances** - Medical emergencies
- 🚒 **Fire Trucks** - Fire response
- 🚓 **Police Vehicles** - Law enforcement
- 🆘 **Custom Emergency Services**

### **Priority Logic**
1. **Detection:** Multi-source (VANET sensors + SUMO vehicle tracking)
2. **Assessment:** Check if emergency vehicle is approaching red light
3. **Action:** Immediate phase switch to green for emergency direction
4. **Extension:** Maintain green until emergency vehicle clears intersection

    -20.0 * queue_length_penalty +          # Penalize long queues
    -5.0 * acceleration_penalty +           # Penalize jerky motion

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **Connection Errors**
```bash
# Kill existing SUMO processes
killall sumo-gui

# Clear and restart
cd /home/mahesh/Desktop/capstone/vanet_final_v3
./run_sumo_rl.sh
```

#### **Poor Training Performance**
```bash
# Check current model
ls -la rl_module/models/

# Retrain with more episodes
cd rl_module
python3 train_working.py --episodes 150 --steps 1500
```

#### **Emergency Vehicles Not Detected**
- Ensure vehicle names contain "emergency", "ambulance", or "fire"
- Check that vehicles are within 300m of intersections
- Verify VANET sensor network is properly initialized

#### **Traffic Lights Not Changing**
- Check that RL model is loaded (models/dqn_traffic_model.pth exists)
- Verify 16 action combinations are properly configured
- Ensure no connection errors interrupting the control loop

### **Performance Tuning**
- **Increase Training:** More episodes/steps for better learning
- **Adjust Rewards:** Fine-tune penalty/bonus weights
- **Monitor Metrics:** Watch for improving episode rewards
- **Test Iteratively:** Compare RL vs rule-based performance
