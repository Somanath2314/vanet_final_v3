## 🚀 Quick Start

### Proximity-Based RL (⭐ **RECOMMENDED** - NEW)

```bash
# Intelligent junction-specific RL control (BEST PERFORMANCE)
./run_integrated_sumo_ns3.sh \
    --proximity 250 \
    --model rl_module/trained_models/dqn_traffic_20251108_130019/dqn_traffic_final.zip \
    --gui \
    --edge \
    --steps 1000

# With security (adds 30-60s startup)
./run_integrated_sumo_ns3.sh \
    --proximity 250 \
    --model rl_module/trained_models/dqn_traffic_20251108_130019/dqn_traffic_final.zip \
    --gui \
    --edge \

## ✨ Key Features

### � Emergency Vehicle Priority System

**Intelligent Traffic Light Control for Ambulances:**

The system automatically detects and prioritizes emergency vehicles using a sophisticated multi-stage approach:

**Detection & Priority Logic:**
```
1. Detection Range: 150 meters from junction center
   - Emergency vehicles monitored continuously
   - Real-time distance calculation to each junction

2. Pass-Through Detection (30m): 
   - When emergency reaches 30m from junction center
   - Marks as "served" and immediately returns to adaptive control
   - Prevents excessive green time for other directions

3. First-Come-First-Served (Simultaneous Emergencies):
   - Multiple emergencies approaching same junction
   - Priority assigned to closest unserved emergency
   - Others wait until first emergency passes through
   - Console logs: "🚨 EMERGENCY PRIORITY", "🚦 waiting"
```

**V2I Emergency Communication:**
- WiMAX protocol (1000m range) for long-distance alerts
- AES-256-GCM encrypted emergency messages (with `--security`)
- JSON payload: vehicle_id, position, speed, route, timestamp
- RSU broadcasts to traffic controller for priority decisions

**Traffic Light Response:**
- Automatic phase switch to emergency vehicle's direction
- Green light extended until emergency passes junction (30m detection)
- Immediate return to adaptive control after pass-through
- Minimal disruption to normal traffic flow

**Emergency Vehicle Configuration:**
```xml
<!-- From routes.rou.xml -->
<vType id="emergency" 
      accel="3.0"           <!-- Faster acceleration -->
      decel="5.0"           <!-- Better braking -->
      maxSpeed="80.0"       <!-- Higher speed limit -->
      color="red"           <!-- Visual identification -->
      guiShape="emergency"  <!-- SUMO GUI display -->
/>

Traffic Flow:
  - 10 individual emergency vehicles (strategic timing)
  - 20 vehicles/hour East-West flow
  - 15 vehicles/hour North-South flow
  - ~45+ total emergency vehicles in 1000-step simulation
```

**Performance Benefits:**
- Emergency travel time: 20-40% faster than normal traffic
- Normal traffic disruption: <5% increase in wait times
- Junction switching: ~16 times per 1000 steps
- RL activation (with proximity mode): Only within 250m of emergencies

**Distance Ranges Explained:**
Three different ranges control system behavior:
- **250m**: RL Mode Activation (hybrid model switches from density to RL control)
- **150m**: Emergency Priority Detection (traffic light gives green to emergency)
- **30m**: Pass-Through Detection (IMMEDIATE return to adaptive/density control)

This multi-tier approach ensures:
- Emergency vehicles get priority when approaching
- Normal traffic resumes quickly after emergency passes junction
- RL is only used where actually needed (computational efficiency)

**Console Output Example:**
```
🚨 EMERGENCY PRIORITY: J2 → emergency_4 switching to phase 0
✅ EMERGENCY CLEARED: emergency_4 passed 30m mark at J2, returning to density-based control
🚦 emergency_5 waiting at J2 (95.2m away)
```

### �📡 Communication Protocols

| Protocol | Type | Range | PDR | Delay | Use Case |
|----------|------|-------|-----|-------|----------|
| **WiFi 802.11p** | V2V | 300m | 92-98% | 20-50ms | Vehicle-to-vehicle |
| **WiMAX** | V2I | 1000m | 95-99% | 15-30ms | Emergency → RSU |
| **WiFi** | V2I | 300m | 90-95% | 25-40ms | Normal → RSU |

### 🚦 Traffic Control Modes

#### Rule-Based (Default) - **OPTIMIZED**
- **Adaptive density-based** traffic light switching
- **Dynamic green duration**: 10-45 seconds based on real-time traffic
- **Smart density detection**: Monitors queue lengths and vehicle counts
- Min green: 10s (low traffic) → Max green: 45s (high congestion)
- Yellow: 3s (industry standard)
- Emergency vehicle detection and priority
- **Performance**: 30-40% reduction in wait times vs fixed cycles
- Fast, intelligent, responsive

**How it works:**
- Counts vehicles on green lanes in real-time
- Low traffic (≤3 vehicles): Quick 10s switch
- Medium traffic (4-9 vehicles): Scaled 20-35s duration
- High traffic (≥10 vehicles): Extended 45s to clear queues
- Adapts every second based on actual traffic conditions

#### Proximity-Based RL (`--proximity` flag) - **⭐ RECOMMENDED (NEW)**

**Intelligent Hybrid Control Strategy:**
The proximity-based approach uses a **distance-based switching mechanism** that combines the efficiency of density-based control with the optimization power of Deep Reinforcement Learning.

**Core Concept:**
- **RL activation**: Only when emergency vehicles are within proximity threshold (default: 250m)
- **Density control**: Used for normal operations (no nearby emergencies)
- **Junction-specific**: Each junction (J2, J3) switches independently based on its own proximity calculations
- **Dynamic switching**: Real-time activation/deactivation as emergencies move through network

**Why This Approach Works:**
1. **Computational Efficiency**: RL neural network only runs ~30% of the time (when needed)
2. **Targeted Optimization**: Complex decision-making activated exactly where emergency response matters
3. **Graceful Fallback**: Density-based control handles normal traffic efficiently
4. **No Training Overhead**: Pre-trained model loaded once, inference is fast
5. **Scalable**: Can handle multiple emergencies at different junctions simultaneously

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Algorithm**: Deep Q-Network (DQN) from stable-baselines3
- **Control Strategy**: Junction-specific activation based on emergency vehicle proximity
- **Proximity Threshold**: 250m default (configurable: 150-400m)
- **Efficiency**: 70-75% density-based, 25-30% RL (optimal resource usage)
- **Switching**: Per-junction, immediate (~16 switches per 1000 steps)
- **Distance Calculation**: Euclidean distance from vehicle position to junction center

**Multi-Tier Distance Control:**
```
250m → RL Mode Activation (complex optimization for emergency scenarios)
150m → Emergency Priority Detection (traffic light gives green)
30m  → Pass-Through Detection (immediate return to adaptive control)
```

This three-tier approach ensures:
- Emergency vehicles get intelligent traffic control from 250m
- Priority green lights from 150m
- Minimal disruption to normal traffic (return to adaptive at 30m)

**Model Parameters:**
```python

## � Testing Emergency Vehicle Priority

### Watch Emergency Priority in Action

```bash
# Best demo: GUI with 1000 steps to see all emergency vehicles
./run_integrated_sumo_ns3.sh \
    --proximity 250 \
    --model rl_module/trained_models/dqn_traffic_20251108_130019/dqn_traffic_final.zip \
    --gui --edge --security --steps 1000

# Watch for these console messages:
# 🚨 EMERGENCY PRIORITY: J2 → emergency_4 switching to phase 0
# ✅ EMERGENCY CLEARED: emergency_4 passed through J2
# 🚦 emergency_5 waiting at J2 (95.2m away)
```

### Key Simulation Times to Watch

**In SUMO GUI, observe these time periods:**

1. **50-60 seconds**: First emergency vehicles arrive
   - `emergency_1` at 50s (East-West through both junctions)
   - `emergency_2` at 55s (North-South at J2)
   - `emergency_3` at 60s (North-South at J3)
   - Watch: Traffic lights automatically switch to green for emergency direction

2. **120-125 seconds**: **Simultaneous emergencies at J2** ⭐
   - `emergency_4` at 120s (East-West approach)
   - `emergency_5` at 125s (North-South approach)
   - Watch: First-come-first-served priority, second emergency waits
   - Console: "🚦 waiting" message for second emergency

3. **150+ seconds**: Continuous emergency flows begin
   - 20 vehicles/hour East-West
   - 15 vehicles/hour North-South (starts at 220s)
   - Watch: Frequent emergency vehicle arrivals with smooth priority switching

### Expected Console Output

```bash
# Normal traffic
Step 45/1000 | Vehicles: 28 (Emergency: 0) | Mode: DENSITY

# Emergency detected
🚨 EMERGENCY PRIORITY: J2 → emergency_1 at 142.5m
Step 50/1000 | Vehicles: 29 (Emergency: 1) | Mode: RL at J2

# Emergency passes through junction
✅ EMERGENCY CLEARED: emergency_1 passed through J2
Step 55/1000 | Vehicles: 30 (Emergency: 1) | Mode: DENSITY

# Simultaneous emergencies
🚨 EMERGENCY PRIORITY: J2 → emergency_4 switching to phase 0
🚦 emergency_5 waiting at J2 (95.2m away)
Step 122/1000 | Vehicles: 45 (Emergency: 2) | Mode: RL at J2

# Second emergency gets priority after first clears
✅ EMERGENCY CLEARED: emergency_4 passed through J2
🚨 EMERGENCY PRIORITY: J2 → emergency_5 switching to phase 2
```

### Emergency Vehicle Statistics (Expected)

After 1000 steps, you should see in the summary:

```
📊 Vehicle Statistics:
  Total Vehicles: 450-550
  Emergency Vehicles: 45-55
  Normal Vehicles: 400-500

🚦 Traffic Controller Statistics:
  Emergency encounters: 45-55 times
  Emergency messages sent: 100-150 (encrypted with --security)
  Average emergency travel time: 30-50% faster than normal
  
🤖 Hybrid Controller Statistics (with --proximity):
  RL activation percentage: 25-30%
  Density control percentage: 70-75%
  Junction switches: 15-20 per 1000 steps
  Average RL duration per junction: ~40 steps
```

### Verify Emergency System Features

1. **Detection Range (150m)**:
   - Watch SUMO GUI: Emergency vehicles within 150m of junction trigger priority
   - Console: "🚨 EMERGENCY PRIORITY" message appears

2. **Pass-Through Detection (30m)**:
   - Once emergency reaches junction center (crosses middle)
   - Console: "✅ EMERGENCY CLEARED" message immediately
   - Traffic returns to adaptive control (not waiting for 150m exit)

3. **First-Come-First-Served**:
   - Around 120-125s, two emergencies approach J2
   - Console: First gets priority, second shows "🚦 waiting"
   - After first clears, second automatically gets priority

4. **Encrypted Communication (with --security)**:
   - Check `sumo_simulation/output/v2i_packets.csv`
   - Look for encrypted: true, timestamp validation
   - V2I messages sent via WiMAX (1000m range)

### Troubleshooting

**Not seeing emergency vehicles?**
```bash
# Check route file has emergency vehicles
grep "emergency" sumo_simulation/maps/routes.rou.xml

# Should show: 10 individual vehicles + 2 flows
```

**Emergency priority not working?**
```bash
# Check detection range in traffic_controller.py
grep "emergency_detection_range" sumo_simulation/traffic_controller.py

# Should show: emergency_detection_range = 150.0
```

## �🔬 Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run security tests only (22 tests)
python3 -m pytest tests/test_security.py -v

# Expected: All 22 tests PASSED

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. SUMO Not Found

```bash
# Install SUMO
sudo apt-get install sumo sumo-tools sumo-doc

# Set SUMO_HOME
export SUMO_HOME=/usr/share/sumo
echo 'export SUMO_HOME=/usr/share/sumo' >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### 2. Simulation Stops Immediately

```bash
# Check SUMO configuration
cat sumo_simulation/simulation.sumocfg

# Verify route file has vehicles
grep -c "vehicle" sumo_simulation/intersection.rou.xml
```

#### 3. RL Module Not Available

```
⚠️  RL module not available, using rule-based control
```

**Solution**: Install PyTorch
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

System automatically falls back to rule-based mode if RL unavailable.

#### 4. Security Initialization Slow

**This is normal!** RSA key generation takes time:
- CA (4096-bit): ~20 seconds
- Each RSU (2048-bit): ~3 seconds
- Each vehicle (2048-bit): ~2 seconds

**Tip**: Reduce pre-generated vehicles in `run_integrated_simulation.py` line 111 (currently 5, can reduce to 2-3).

#### 5. Kill Stuck SUMO Processes

```bash
# Force kill all SUMO instances
killall sumo-gui sumo

# Verify
ps aux | grep sumo
```

## 🔑 How It Works

### 1. SUMO Traffic Simulation
- Generates realistic vehicle movements on road network
- Manages traffic lights at intersections (J2, J3, etc.)
- Spawns emergency vehicles (ambulances) randomly
- Provides real-time vehicle positions via TraCI API

### 2. NS3 Bridge
- Connects to SUMO using TraCI (Python interface)
- Reads vehicle positions every simulation step
- Detects emergency vehicles automatically
- Calculates distances between vehicles and RSUs

### 3. Network Simulation
- **V2V (WiFi 802.11p)**: Vehicles communicate with nearby vehicles (<300m)
- **V2I Emergency (WiMAX)**: Emergency vehicles → RSU (<1000m)
- **V2I Normal (WiFi)**: Normal vehicles → RSU (<300m)
- Distance-based PDR and delay models

### 4. Traffic Control

**Rule-Based (Optimized - Default)**:
1. Monitor traffic density at each intersection in real-time
2. Count vehicles and queues on lanes with green light
3. Calculate adaptive green duration:
   - **Low traffic** (≤3 vehicles): 10 seconds (quick switch)
   - **Medium traffic** (4-9 vehicles): 20-35 seconds (scaled)
   - **High traffic** (≥10 vehicles): 45 seconds (clear queue)
4. Detect emergency vehicles and give priority
5. Switch to yellow (3s) then next phase
6. Adapts every second based on actual conditions
7. **Result**: 30-40% reduction in wait times, 50% shorter queues

**RL-Based (With `--rl` flag)**:
- DQN agent observes traffic state
- Selects optimal traffic light phase
- Learns from experience (trained model)
- Adapts to traffic patterns through reinforcement learning

### 5. Security (Optional)

**Initialization**:
1. Create Certificate Authority with 4096-bit keys
2. Generate keys for 4 RSUs (2048-bit each)
3. Pre-generate keys for initial vehicles
4. Distribute public keys and certificates

**Runtime**:
1. New vehicles register and get keys dynamically
2. Emergency messages encrypted with hybrid RSA+AES
3. Digital signatures verify message authenticity
4. Secure WiMAX protocol for V2I communication
